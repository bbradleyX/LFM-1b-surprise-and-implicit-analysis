# LFM-1b Analysis with the Surprise and Implicit Libraries

This repository serves as a hub for our current research of the [LastFM 1 Billion dataset](http://www.cp.jku.at/datasets/LFM-1b/).  

The goal is to reproduce the findings in this paper: [The Unfairness of Popularity Bias in Music
Recommendation: A Reproducibility Study](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.04696.pdf)  

We will to use the same, groups and the Surprise Library to reproduce their results. Once we do, we will run the data through the Implicit library as well, along with attempting to use different groups of users to see if the result stays the same.
